## Dataset choice

For this Analysis the flights dataset has been chosen. Given my background and interest in Aeronautic, this comes as a natural choice. 

## Summary

The data comes originally from RITA where it is described in detail. These files have derivable variables removed, are packaged in yearly chunks and have been more heavily compressed than the originals.
the current analysis focus on the 2008 flights.


## Design
Link to the Story

Design aims to be simple. Colors are uniforms per and elements of High importance are highlighted in a gradient color (darker or brighter).

##  Feedback 

An Overview of all the dataset has been added (i.e. Map).
