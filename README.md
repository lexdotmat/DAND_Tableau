# DAND_Tableau

Github repository for the Tableau project of the Data Analytics NanoDegree.

## Dataset choice

For this Analysis the flights dataset has been chosen. Given my background and interest in Aeronautic (I've worked different industries related to Aeronautic), this comes as a natural choice. 

## Summary

The data comes originally from RITA where it is described in detail. These files have derivable variables removed, are packaged in yearly chunks and have been more heavily compressed than the originals.
the current analysis focus on the 2008 flights.


## Design

Design aims to be simple. Colors are uniforms per graphics and elements of High importance are highlighted using a gradient color (darker or brighter).

##  Feedback 

You might need to ask specific questions to prompt the reader. Here are some questions to help you. You can, of course, ask others.

- What questions do you have about the data? 
What about the other Locations? In Europa and Asia ?

- What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
The most visited Airport in 2008 was Chicago, most probably Atlanta in the next following years. 

- Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic? 
No

An Overview of all the dataset has been added (i.e. Map), however, regarding the other continent, they are not present into the data. I personnaly also tried to add Aircraft type into the vizualization to understand what types of traffic was present and found too much NA values to correctly take this variable into account.
